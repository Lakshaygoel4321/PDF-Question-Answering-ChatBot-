# <h1 align="center">📄 PDF Question/Answering ChatBot 🤖</h1>

## <h2>🚀 Project Overview</h2>
In today's fast-paced world, searching for specific information within documents can be time-consuming.  
To solve this, I developed a PDF Question/Answering ChatBot, allowing users to:  

✔ Upload multiple PDF files at once.  
✔ Embed documents and create a searchable database.  
✔ Ask questions, and the chatbot retrieves precise answers only from the uploaded documents.  

This chatbot is built using NVIDIA’s powerful LLaMA 3.1 Nemotron-70B Instruct model and deployed on Hugging Face, making it efficient and accessible. 🚀
